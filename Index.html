        <h1>Rest in Peace Technoblade, 1999-2022</h1>
        <h5>R.I.P. Technoblade</h5>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jordan Briggs, and this is my way to contributing to Technoblade's death, as I am not apart of the Hypixel community. Alexander, otherwise known as Technoblade by many, has just recently passed away from Stage 4 Cancer, at the age of 23. Technoblade was a huge impiration in the Minecraft community, and since the age of 10, he's had the dream to reach 10 millon subscribers on YouTube. Technoblade joined YouTube in 2013, at the age of 14. Technoblade made the community laugh, and filled us with joyment, even if his upload schedule was 1 video per month. Many were affected by Technoblade's loss, as expected. And whilst Technoblade only had 12 million subscribers on YouTube, his latest video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPMluEVUqS0&t=309s" target="_blank">so long nerds</a> has reached 34 million views on YouTube, aprox. 2.83x his subscriber count. Technoblade will be missed by us, and our lives will forever be changed. <br />
        May Alexander, 1999-2022 Rest in Peace. You will not be forgotten.</p>
